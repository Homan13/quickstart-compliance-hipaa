As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* Three virtual private clouds (VPCs) configured with subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS. The management VPC is for your security and infrastructure controls. The production VPC is for deploying your production workloads. The development VPC is for deploying your development workloads.
* In the management VPC:
** An internet gateway, which serves as a highly available https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/centralized-egress-to-internet.html[centralized point of egress for internet traffic^].
** Public subnets that include managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** Private subnets are for deploying your security and infrastructure controls. 
** Flow logs for auditing purposes.
* In the production VPC:
** Private subnets are for deploying your production workloads. 
** Flow logs for auditing purposes.
* In the development VPC:
** Private subnets for deploying your development workloads. 
** Flow logs for auditing purposes.
* AWS Transit Gateway for VPC-to-VPC communication and customer connectivity.
* For logging and audit controls:
** Amazon CloudWatch for metric monitoring and threshold alarms. This service delivers flow logs to an S3 bucket.
** AWS Config with the conformance pack for HIPAA, maps HIPAA controls to AWS configuration items. This service delivers flow logs to an S3 bucket.
** AWS CloudTrail for AWS access logging. This service delivers flow logs to an S3 bucket.
* For customer connectivity:
** AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect to connect with AWS Transit Gateway.
* For access control and alerting:
** Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) for sending email alerts from alarms.
** AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control and authorization.
