This Quick Start helps automate building a baseline architecture that fits within your organization's larger HIPAA-compliance program. Like other AWS compliance architectures, it helps streamline, automate, and implement secure baselines in AWSâ€”from initial design to operational security readiness. It incorporates the expertise of AWS solutions architects, security, and compliance personnel to help you build a secure and reliable architecture through automation.

This Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates, which can be integrated with AWS Service Catalog, to automate building a baseline architecture that fits within your organization's larger HIPAA-compliance program. It also includes a security controls reference, which maps HIPAA regulatory requirements to architecture decisions, features, and configuration of the baseline.
